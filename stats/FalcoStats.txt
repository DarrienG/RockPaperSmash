Falco, the ace pilot epitomizes a glass cannon more than any other character. With the weakest recovery in the game,
and a gravity that make horizontal kills happen at extremely low percents, Falco is dead off of a couple of hits.

Anybody who has played Falco in Melee though knows that he has devastating offensive power once he gets something going.
Falco in Rock Paper Smash is no different. His moves begin weak, and with every consecutive hit, they become 2.0 times
more powerful than their last hit. Falco's power skyrockets the more hits he gets.

Once a Falco combo ends though, he becomes weak and vulnerable again. Falco is a scary character to face once he gets
something going.
