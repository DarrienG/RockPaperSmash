Falco, the ace pilot is back again, taking the glass cannon archetype, and pushing it to the limits. Dying at
both incredibly low percentages and able to rack up percentages on foes extremely fast, Falco has a very high
risk, high reward play style. Even a single mistake as or against a Falco at a low percent means death.

Falco has the highest overall damage output of any character. Even off of basic attacks, it is a guarantee that
if the foe is hit, they'll take at least 25 damage. The incredibly high damage output also carries over to
knockback, in that his moves are very hard hitting, giving the opponent no chance to breathe when hit.

Falco can do even more damage if gets his pillar combos. He can rack up, up to 70% damage in a single hit
depending on the opponent's gravity. All in all, Falco is a force to be reckoned with.
