The renowned bounty hunter Captain Falcon
is ready to race. Dispatching foes with a
lightning fast combos, Falcon is no joke.

It may not be true, but Falcon's grab to
knee is devastating, and will probably
work. Even if it doesn't, you'll still
look pretty damn cool.

Captain Falcon does a reasonable
amount of damage on his own, but it is
when he gets his grab -> knee (attack),
he will deal double damage, and double
knockback.

Be careful though! Grab -> knee isn't
guaranteed! There is a chance it will miss
even if you get both attacks off and just
do a regular attack.

Raw stats:

  Move    Dmg   Kb     Angle
-------- ----- ---- ------------
 Attack    13   60   Horizontal
 Grab      15   40   Horizontal
 Shield    12   50   Vertical

 High risk, high reward
