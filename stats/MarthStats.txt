The hero king makes a return! Known for his spacing in Melee, Marth is based off of grabs, and tippers
in Rock Paper Smash.

Marth is a character with a very powerful grab. Using grab is a great way to rack up damage quickly.
Despite having a high damage output, grab is a weak option for securing a kill, with a measly 10 knockback.

While it would appear Marth's other options are all awful, Marth has a 30% chance of hitting his special
(tippers) while attacking. By getting a tipper, Marth's attack power doubles, and knockback grows by 1.25,
making his seemingly weak normal attack deal 18 damage, and have an astonishingly high 18.75 knockback, making
it a very viable kill move.

Despite having a powerful attack, and grab, Marth suffers from weak out of shield options, only being able to deal
5 damage off of a shield punish, with a total of 7 knockback, making shielding a below average choice for him.
