Fox, the Lylat Commander is at it again. Ready to dominate the metagame with his trademarked glass cannon playstyle.

Fox is an astonishingly powerful character. All of his moves deal a very high amount of damage, with his OOS moves
doing the least at 18 damage. Out of shield shine combos, however, have ridiculous knockback, and with its 90
knockback, Fox has few offensive flaws.

In addition to this, during any of his moves, there is a 15% chance of 20XX occurring, thus increasing the damage
output of that particular move 1.5 times, making Fox a true force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

Despite having absolutely incredible power, and a solid recovery, Fox's very high gravity will cause him to die
quickly when knocked horizontally. While this does have the added benefit of protecting him from vertical kills,
anything horizontal at percentages much lower than the majority of the cast.
