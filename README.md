Rock Paper Smash is a fighting game that pushes the rock, paper, scissors meta of the Super Smash Brother series to forefront.

In standard Super Smash Bros. during a match, the player has three options, to attack, to grab, or to shield. Attack beats grab, grab beats shield, and shield beats attack. However, unlike standard rock, paper, scissors, in Smash Bros. picking a move is not as cut and dry as picking any of the three options. Each character has different reasons to want to choose to attack, or grab, or shield. For example, Falco's raw attack game is incredibly powerful in Smash Bros. and as such, it is often in a Falco player's best interests to choose jump in and attack, as they know it is their strongest option, even if it isn't necessarily the best option for them to choose in that situation. In short, while each player has the same moves, each character has their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to each move.

Also similar in that if you win a round in the combat triangle in Smash Bros. you don't immediately defeat your foe. The opponent gets percentage tacked on, and the higher their percentage goes, the greater the likelihood they will be knocked out. 

In Rock Paper Smash, both of these are idealized in what would normally be the standard rock, paper, scissors metagame. Each character has different reasons to want to choose each move, and different advantages and disadvantages to each move. And when beating a foe in a single round, percentage is tacked on, but the other player does not immediately win. Your opponent could have a higher damage percent than you, and still win depending on that character's strengths and weaknesses.

To play, you need to have Java installed. Your command prompt or terminal will also need to be maximized in order to fully view the text art. Being able to fully view the art is not required to play, but makes the experience much better.

Click on releases in the top bar, and download the zip. 

Extract all of the files from the archive.

If you're on Windows, open up the Command Prompt (search for cmd, press <ENTER>). If you're on OS X, or Linux, open up the terminal.

Navigate to the directory you unzipped in your command prompt.

If you're on Windows 8.1 or older, type in 

    wmic
    
Then press the maximize button on your terminal.

Finally, type this command:

    java -jar RPS_V1.jar
    
And you can begin the game. Please note that all of the included directories must be in the same place as the .jar file for the game to run. 

If you would like to move the jar file, or keep it in a directory on its own, you'll need to make a shortcut to it, and then place that elsewhere.
